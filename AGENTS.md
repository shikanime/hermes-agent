# Hermes Agent

The agent that grows with you: an adaptive AI coding assistant.

**Language:** Python/Rust

## Structure

- `src/` — Core logic
- `tools/` — Helper tools for agent operations
- `skills/` — Adaptive skill definitions

## Commit Style

- Plain-text capitalized title, no conventional-commit prefix
- Body with labels: `Design:`, `Related:`, `Closes #`
- Keep Markdown lines wrapped at 80 columns and run `nix fmt` before shipping

## Stack

- 1 commit == 1 PR via ghstack
- Amend + `ghstack` to resubmit
- `ghstack land` on head PR to land the entire stack
- Never `gh pr merge` (creates poisoned commits)
- Never force-push ghstack branches
- ghstack only works on HEAD commit chains, not detached HEADs

## Protect `main`

- Require 1 approving review
- Require linear history (no merge commits)
- Require signed commits
- Squash+rebase merge only

*Critical system repo. Every change must be validated via integration tests*
